\section{Conclusions}
\textcolor{blue}{Well duh, give a conclusion and maybe outlook.}\\
\textcolor{red}{Mention that the PyCBC Live pipeline has probably (talk to Alex about this) a higher latency than our search (they have latency on average \SI{16}{\s} \cite{pycbc_live}) but already give rough parameter estimation and sky localization which we can't do. They furthermore are a lot more sensitive.}
