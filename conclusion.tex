\section{Conclusions}
\textcolor{blue}{Well duh, give a conclusion and maybe outlook.}\\
\textcolor{red}{Mention that the PyCBC Live pipeline has probably (talk to Alex about this) a higher latency than our search (they have latency on average \SI{16}{\s} \cite{pycbc_live}) but already give rough parameter estimation and sky localization which we can't do. They furthermore are a lot more sensitive.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item First time anybody tested sensitivity of a \gls{nn} for \gls{bns} signals at such a low false alarm rate
	\item Computationally very efficient therefore lower latency (need to quantify this)
	\item At the moment network probably too complicated and therefore hyper parameters probably not optimal
	\item Introduced new architecture of using a TCN as denoiser. Also the cascading architecture is new and promising
	\item Network not yet ready to use
	\item Couldn't work with real detector data yet, as it also wouldn't be sensible with our sensitivity
	\item Still interesting as it has shown potential with easier data
\end{itemize}
