\section{Our network}
\textcolor{red}{For the title: Maybe name the final network and use that name as a title.\\Explain what we are trying to do once more and how our net achieves that.}
\subsection{Training data}
\textcolor{red}{Explain how the data is generated (especially that it only contains gaussian noise), what its shape is and why it has that shape. Also explain the split into training-, validation and testing set and why it is useful.}
\subsection{Training and final performance}
\textcolor{red}{Talk about how long training took on what kind of hardware. How does the loss evolve? Are we sure we leveled off? How accurate are the predictions?}
\subsection{Comparison to matched filtering}
\textcolor{red}{Compare the speeds of both methods, the accuracy. What kind of drawbacks does the network have, what are its advantages, how should it be used and understood? (Not as a standalone method of analysis but rather as a starting point for samplers and a quick way of estimate certain properties.)}
